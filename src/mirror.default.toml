# This is a Panamax mirror. It is a self-contained directory made to be easily copied
# to an offline network or machine via rsync, USB, or another method.

# While Panamax handles grabbing files from the Internet, it does not handle hosting
# on the offline. Since everything in the mirror is static, it should be
# fairly easily hosted using nginx, and git for the crates.io-index mirror.
